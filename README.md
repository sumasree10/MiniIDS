Project Title: Mini IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
Project Overview
This project is a Mini Intrusion Detection System (IDS) simulator. It consists of two main parts:

Java Backend Simulator: A Java program (IDS.java) that simulates the generation of network logs. It randomly creates log entries, identifies some as "NORMAL" and others as "MALICIOUS," and saves them to a logs.json file.

Web Frontend Dashboard: A web page (index.html) that reads the logs.json file to display the logs in a user-friendly dashboard. This dashboard provides statistics, filtering, and real-time alerts for new malicious activity.

Component Breakdown
1. Backend (Java Log Simulator)
IDS.java (Main Program):

This is the main application.

It generates 10 LogEntry objects using the LogGenerator.

As it generates logs, it prints them to the console.

If a log's status is "MALICIOUS," it prints an [ALERT] message to the console with the IP address.

It saves all 10 logs in JSON format to a hardcoded file path: C:\Users\Hasmitha S\Desktop\mini-ids\web\logs.json.

LogGenerator.java:

A helper class used to create new log entries.

The generateLog() method creates a log with a random IP address (in the 192.168.1.X range) and a randomly assigned status of either "NORMAL" or "MALICIOUS".

LogEntry.java:

A simple Java data class (POJO) that holds the ipAddress and status for a single log entry.

2. Data File (The "Bridge")
logs.json:

This file acts as the bridge between the Java backend and the web frontend.

It is generated by IDS.java and read by script.js.

It contains an array of log objects, each with an "ip" and "status" property.

3. Frontend (Web Dashboard)
index.html:

Defines the HTML structure for the "Mini IDS Dashboard".

Includes a statistics display area (id="logStats").

Contains control buttons: "Load Latest Logs" and filter buttons ("Show All," "Normal Logs," "Malicious Logs").

Has a table (id="logTable") where the log data will be displayed.

Links the style.css and script.js files.

style.css:

Provides the visual styling for the dashboard.

Sets a "sky blue gradient" background for the page.

Styles the log table with a semi-transparent light blue background and rounded corners.

Defines color-coded status badges: .status.normal is soft blue, and .status.malicious is light red.

Styles the buttons with gradients and hover effects.

script.js (Dashboard Logic):

Auto-Refresh: Automatically loads logs every 5 seconds using setInterval(loadLogs, 5000).

Data Loading: The loadLogs() function fetches the logs.json file. It uses a cache-busting parameter (?cache= + Date.now()) to ensure it always gets the latest file.

Real-time Alerting: When logs are loaded, the script checks for any "MALICIOUS" logs. If it finds a malicious IP that it hasn't alerted for before, it triggers a browser alert() pop-up (e.g., ⚠️ New MALICIOUS activity detected from 192.168.1.88).

Statistics: After loading, the renderTable() function updates the "logStats" element with the total, normal, and malicious log counts.

Table Rendering: renderTable() dynamically builds the HTML table rows based on the loaded data and the current filter setting.

Filtering: Click listeners are added to the filter buttons. When clicked, they update the currentFilter variable, add an "active" class to the pressed button, and re-render the table to show only "ALL," "NORMAL," or "MALICIOUS" logs.
